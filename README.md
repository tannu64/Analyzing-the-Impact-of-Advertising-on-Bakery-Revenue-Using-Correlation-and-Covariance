# Project: Analyzing the Impact of Advertising on Bakery Revenue

## Problem Statement
A bakery owner wants to understand how spending on social media advertising influences monthly revenue. The goal is to compute the correlation coefficient and covariance between advertising spending and revenue to determine the strength and direction of their relationship. This insight will help the bakery make informed decisions about future advertising investments.
